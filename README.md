# 🚀 n8n Automation Project

## Overview
This project is an automation built using **n8n**, designed to automate a real-world workflow.

This is my **first automation project** created to demonstrate my skills in:
- Workflow automation
- API integration
- Data handling
- No-code / low-code tools

---

## What This Automation Does
- Triggers when: [Webhook / Schedule / Manual Trigger]
- Processes data using: [Set / IF / Function nodes]
- Sends data to: [Email / Google Sheets / Slack / API]

Example:
> When a webhook receives data, the workflow formats it and sends a notification.
The core goals are:
• streamline workflow automation end-to-end
• weave in an integrated chatbot that triggers or responds to those flows
• handle data transformation on the fly, especially text blocks and JSON/XML payloads coming from APIs and webhooks
---

## Workflow Steps
1. Trigger starts the workflow
2. Data is processed and validated
3. Action is executed (API / notification / storage)

---

## Tools & Technologies
- n8n
- REST APIs
- Webhooks
- JSON

---

## How to Use This Workflow
1. Install n8n (Cloud / Desktop / Self-hosted)
2. Import `workflow.json`
